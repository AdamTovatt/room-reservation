# Kth Lediga Salar

This repository is the code for the website available at: https://tentap.online/

## Purpose

The purpose of this website is to enable students at KTH to see what rooms are available to study in. I just want to help people.

### Contribution

If you want to contribute, you are very welcome to do so. This is just a normal react app. Don't expect anything fancy, I'm not a front end developer. If you've made changes and want them included you can create a pull request. You can contact me if that doesn't work or you have other questions: adam@sakur.se

## API
